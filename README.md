# Protractor_Angular_Automation
E2E testing of Angular Websites using protractor to overcome synchronization issues.

## Why Do we Need Protractor ???

1. Selenium Driver dost not have methods/featues to locate elements based on Angular specific properties/locators. Locatores such as waitForAngular, By.binding, by.repeater and so on.
2. protracter is a wrapper over webdriverJS and provide support to find angular specifc elements.
3. To overcome Synchronization issues while automating Angular(JS) application with selenium webdriver.
4. Protractor allows asynchronization which allows multiple things to happen at the same time.
